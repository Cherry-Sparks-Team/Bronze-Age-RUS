 game_concept_title_desc:1 "A $game_concept_title$ is essentially a certificate of land ownership.\n\nThe smallest unit of land on the map is the [barony|E]. Communities are organized into larger areas called [counties|E]. Provinces [de_jure|E] belong to a [duchy|E], Kingdoms to a [kingdom|E], and High Kingdoms to an [empire|E].\n\nKingdoms, High Kingdoms and Empires do not always have a [holder|E], but are Titles that can be [created|E] by a ruler who controls enough of the corresponding territory."
 game_concept_de_jure_desc:1 "Most [titles|E] are considered part of a higher-level title $game_concept_de_jure$ (by law).\n\nThe [holder|E] of such a higher-level title always has a [casus_belli|E] to seize control of its $game_concept_de_jure$ constituent titles.\n\nFor example, a king might not actually control all of the $game_concept_de_jure$ constituent [counties|E] of the [duchy|E], but can declare war to seize them."
 game_concept_de_jure_drift_desc_part_1:0 "A slow process by which a [title|E]'s [de_jure|E] [liege|E] can change. It occurs naturally when a [duchy|E] or [kingdom|E] is completely controlled by a [ruler|E] who does not hold the territory's de jure liege title.\n\nThis process can be sped up by assigning your [chancellor|E] to the appropriate [councillor_task|E] #weak ($task_integrate_title$)#!. Kingdoms can only $game_concept_de_jure_drift$ into High Kingdoms, and High Kingdoms can only Drift into [empires|E].\n\nLetting titles De Jure Drift into your [primary_title|E] is a good way to get rid of the [rightful_liege|E] penalty."
